# Photogrammetry pattern generator

This is a very simple photogrammetry pattern generator. Just open `index.html` in your browser and create your pattern to be printed.

## What is it useful for ?

[Photogrammetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry) is use to create 3d models from pictures of the same object or scene taken from several angle.

When you want to use photogrammetry has a way to 3d scan small objects using a turntable, a unified background and a fixed camera, you usually encounter an issue where the software cannot find consistent point-of-interest in the background and therefore is unable to reconstruct the scenery.

One workaround for this issue is to print a pattern on the turntable that is easily detectable by the software and help it tack point of interest in order for it to reconstruct the 3d model.

This project aim to make it easy to create such a pattern with the properties of having easily identifiable objects, even with low resolution shots.
